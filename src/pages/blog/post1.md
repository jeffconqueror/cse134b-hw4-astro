# 3D Object Asset Rigging Pipeline

## Overview

This project develops a fully automated pipeline that transforms text descriptions into rigged and textured 3D objects ready for game engines.

## Technologies

- **Blender Python API** for automated mesh processing
- **Text-to-3D Models** (Meshy API)
- **VLM-based Classification** for part identification
- **Unreal Engine** for final asset integration

## Key Features

1. Automated mesh segmentation
2. Skeletal rigging without manual intervention
3. Material and texture application
4. Export to game-ready formats

## Results

Successfully processed over 100 bicycle models with 95% accuracy in part classification.
